# Obstacle-Avoiding-Car
In this project, we'll build an obstacleavoiding car using a Chassis Car Kit, Ultrasonic Sensor, Servo Motor (SG90), L298n motor driver module, and an Arduino UNO. This autonomous vehicle can detect and navigate around obstacles, making it a versatile and practical project for both beginners and experienced hobbyists.
